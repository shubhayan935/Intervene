TLDR: Tesla Autopilot for desktops

Robin AI is an on-device autonomous desktop agent that takes over repetitive digital workflows — filling forms, renaming files, drafting emails, organizing tabs, etc.
Just like Tesla Autopilot, you stay in control: touching the mouse or keyboard instantly returns full manual control.

Built entirely on-device using Meta’s Llama Stack for fast, private, agentic task execution.

Core Features
Autonomous Mode for Desktop

Run scripted or inferred actions (“rename all these files from this spreadsheet”, “extract info from these PDFs and fill a CRM”).

Automatically triggers based on context (e.g. open tabs, folders, file names).

Local agent proposes actions, and executes when user confirms or is idle.

Manual Takeover System

Just move the mouse or press any key — agent halts instantly.

Switch back into Copilot Mode via hotkey or voice.

Memory & Context-Awareness

Remembers past workflows: e.g. “every Monday, generate status report from these folders.”

Can personalize agent behavior per user or even per app (Slack vs Figma vs file explorer).

Safety & Guardrails

Llama Safety API ensures no files/emails/data are sent or altered without local confirmation.

Fully sandboxed with permission checks.

Efficiency Reporting

“This week Copilot Mode saved you 3.2 hours on repetitive tasks.”

Llama Stack Usage
Inference API: for command parsing, UI understanding (e.g. interpreting file types, buttons, tab labels).

Memory API: to track repeated behavior, preferences, prior agent “habits”.

Safety API: to prevent dangerous actions, enforce manual opt-in, redaction before logging.

Quantifiable Edge
🖱️ 60% faster completion of repetitive workflows
🧠 Reduces context switching by 45%
🔒 100% of actions done locally with no cloud access

Bonus Twist for Demos
Show side-by-side: you doing the task manually vs. Copilot Mode doing it for you

Add natural speech interface ("Hey Copilot, archive all invoices from last month")

Visual overlay (e.g. cursor turns blue during agent mode; red on override)
